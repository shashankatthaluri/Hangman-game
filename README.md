🕹 Hangman Game Project 🕹

A fun multiplayer hangman game built with Python! 🐍

🎮 How to Play

This hangman game can be played by 2 players. One player will think of a secret word, and the other tries to guess it letter by letter before running out of guesses!
As guesses are made:
Correct guesses will fill in the matching letters

Run out of lives before guessing the word? You lose!
The first player to correctly guess their opponent's secret word wins the round. Scores are tracked over multiple rounds to determine an overall winner.
